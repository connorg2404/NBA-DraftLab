DOCUMENTATION
-------------

If you wish to read about how the program assigns a value to each pick
in the draft and why the program uses the information and statistics
that it does, please read the PDF document titled "CS152 - Draft Lab.pdf".


HOW TO RUN
----------

To run the program, simply type "./run_trade.sh" into your terminal. 
You will be prompted to type in the numbers of the draft picks you
are giving away (1-60, separated by commas), along with the numbers
of the draft picks you are receiving (1-60, separated by commas).

The program will then determine the value for each draft pick,
and estimate whether you should accept or decline the trade.
